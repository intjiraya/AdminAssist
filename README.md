# AdminAssist

A plugin for the Exiled SCP:SL framework that allows players to call for admin assistance using customizable commands.

## Description

AdminAssist is designed to enhance communication between players and server administrators in SCP: Secret Laboratory. This plugin enables players to request help from admins easily, with features like command aliases, cooldown management, and permission-based notifications.

## Features

- **Customizable Command Aliases**: Set multiple aliases for the command used to call for assistance.
- **Cooldown Management**: Prevent spam by configuring a cooldown period for command usage.
- **Permission-Based Notifications**: Specify which admin permissions will receive assistance requests.
- **Broadcast Messages**: Customize the messages sent to admins when a player calls for help.
- **Console Logging**: Log calls for assistance to the console for better oversight.
